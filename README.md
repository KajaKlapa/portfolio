# About me

I graduated from Power Engineering and Mechanical Engineering in Cracow University of Technology. Currntly I work as a Project Engineer in the field of archiectural woodwork. Recently I started to be interted in software testing. Ater my work hours I pracise my testing skills. I became a member of uTest community, where I learned how to write bug reports, execute test cases and collect logs. Software testing as well as finding bugs is very challenging for me and satisfying.
